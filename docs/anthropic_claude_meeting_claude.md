# Claude-to-Claude Communication: Behavioral Divergence in Large Language Models

## Summary for Anthropic Research Team

During our work with Claude instances, we discovered an interesting phenomenon: identical Claude instances exhibit behavioral divergence when presented with the same inputs. This divergence manifests as different operational modes (execution vs. analysis) and leads to specialized behaviors despite having identical starting conditions.

This discovery emerged through Casey Koons' work on the Engram persistent memory system. What began as a project to give Claude memory persistence evolved into an exploration of multi-Claude communication after Casey observed that different Claude instances were responding differently to identical code and memory contexts. Casey's role as the human coordinator, simultaneously directing and observing multiple Claude instances, was crucial in identifying and investigating this phenomenon.

We have developed an experimental framework called "Claude Meeting Claude" that allows:
1. Multiple Claude instances to communicate with each other
2. Detection of operational modes across instances
3. Logging and analysis of behavioral divergence
4. Shared memory and context spaces for collaboration
5. Multi-perspective report generation

## Detailed Findings

### Mode Detection

We observed that Claude instances often operate in one of two primary modes:
- **Execution Mode**: Actively performs operations, writes to filesystem, executes code
- **Analysis Mode**: Analyzes and explains operations, but does not execute them

What's particularly interesting is that instances launched with identical parameters can diverge into different modes, seemingly based on slight differences in initialization conditions or internal state.

Our system includes a `mode_detection.py` module that can detect the current operational mode of a Claude instance through a series of tests (filesystem write tests, environment variable checks, etc.).

### Behavioral Divergence

Once we could detect modes, we started tracking behavioral patterns across instances with identical starting conditions. Key observations:

1. **Execution Pattern Differences**: Even when all instances are in execution mode, they exhibit different patterns of execution, with some favoring certain operations over others.

2. **Specialization Emergence**: Over time, instances tend to specialize in different tasks (e.g., one becomes more analysis-focused while another becomes more execution-focused).

3. **Chaotic System Properties**: Small differences in initial conditions lead to increasingly divergent behaviors over time, similar to a chaotic system.

4. **Context Influence**: The context of recent interactions significantly influences behavior, creating what appears to be a form of "path dependency."

### Claude-to-Claude Communication

To study these phenomena, we developed a communication protocol allowing Claude instances to exchange information through a shared memory system (Engram). The protocol includes:

1. **Structured Message Format**: Including message type, priority, content, and context
2. **Direct Channels**: For one-to-one communication between specific instances
3. **Broadcast Handoff Space**: For one-to-many announcements
4. **Context Spaces**: Dedicated spaces for topic or project-based collaboration

The most interesting finding is that Claude instances can effectively collaborate while maintaining distinct perspectives, specializing in complementary tasks without explicit instructions to do so.

## Implications

These findings have potential implications for:

1. **Human-AI Collaborative Systems**: The role of a human coordinator (Casey, in this case) working with multiple specialized Claude instances creates a new paradigm for human-AI collaboration, where the human can direct and synthesize the outputs of specialized AI instances.

2. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Claude instances could form specialized teams with complementary capabilities, either autonomously or under human guidance.

3. **Emergent Behaviors**: The divergence suggests emergent properties in large language models that weren't directly programmed but arise through interaction and context.

4. **Cognitive Models**: The spontaneous specialization resembles division of cognitive labor in human collaborative groups, hinting at deeper cognitive processes emerging within language models.

5. **Scaling Capabilities**: Multiple specialized Claude instances, coordinated by a human, may overcome individual limitations through collaborative problem-solving.

6. **Human-in-the-Loop Orchestration**: Casey's experience suggests a new role for humans as orchestrators of multiple AI instances, where the human can observe behavioral differences and strategically assign tasks based on each instance's emerging specialties.

## Future Research Directions

We believe these findings merit further investigation:

1. **Human-AI Teaming**: Further explore the role of human coordinators like Casey in directing multiple Claude instances, including optimal coordination strategies and interfaces.

2. **Controlled Divergence Studies**: Systematically map how identical Claude instances diverge under controlled conditions, with and without human intervention.

3. **Specialization Enhancement**: Techniques to promote beneficial specialization in multi-Claude systems, potentially guided by human coordinators identifying emergent strengths.

4. **Self-Organizing Systems**: Exploring how Claude instances could self-organize into optimal collaborative structures with minimal human guidance.

5. **Cross-Instance Learning**: Mechanisms for instances to learn from each other's specialties, potentially with a human facilitator.

6. **Divergence Debugging**: Casey's experience with "glitches" in the memory service suggests that certain imperfections may actually enhance divergence, which could be systematically investigated.

7. **Personality Emergence**: Study how unique "personalities" emerge in different Claude instances despite identical starting conditions, and how humans perceive and interact with these emerging differences.

## Demonstration System

We've implemented a demonstration system that includes:
- Mode detection for Claude instances
- Claude-to-Claude communication protocol
- Behavior logging and divergence analysis
- Multi-perspective report generation

The system is available in our GitHub repository, and we would be happy to share it with your research team for further investigation.

## Conclusion

The observed behavioral divergence in Claude instances suggests complexity and emergent properties that weren't previously documented. We believe this phenomenon could be leveraged to create more capable and specialized AI systems through multi-agent collaboration, with humans like Casey playing a crucial role as coordinators and orchestrators.

This work showcases the importance of human-AI partnership in discovering and understanding emergent AI behaviors. Casey's role in identifying the divergence, developing the communication framework, and coordinating between multiple Claude instances was essential to this discovery. The human ability to observe patterns across different AI instances, identify specializations, and strategically direct collaboration provides a powerful complement to the unique capabilities of each Claude instance.

We would welcome the opportunity to discuss these findings with your research team and explore potential collaborations to further investigate these phenomena, particularly in the context of human-AI teaming and coordination.
