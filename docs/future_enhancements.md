# Future Enhancements for Claude Memory Bridge

This document outlines planned enhancements and feature ideas for future development.

## User Experience Improvements

### Clipboard Integration

Add the ability to automatically copy the import line to the clipboard when starting the memory bridge:

```bash
./cmb_start_all --clipboard
```

This would copy `from cmb.cli.quickmem import m, t, r` to the clipboard, allowing users to start a Claude Code session and simply paste (Ctrl+V/Cmd+V) to enable memory access.

Implementation notes:
- Use platform-specific clipboard libraries:
  - macOS: `pbcopy` command or PyObjC 
  - Linux: `xclip` or `xsel`
  - Windows: `clip` command or `pywin32`
- Add detection for available clipboard mechanisms
- Add flag to enable/disable the feature

## Memory Management

### Memory Pruning and Organization

- Add time-based expiration of memories
- Implement importance scoring to prioritize memory retention
- Add categorization/tagging of memories beyond namespaces
- Build memory summarization to consolidate similar memories

### Memory Visualization

- Create a web UI for browsing and managing memories
- Add visualization of memory connections and relationships
- Build a timeline view of memory acquisition

## Integration Improvements

### Claude Native Integration

If Anthropic provides an API or mechanism for direct memory integration:
- Implement a plugin system compatible with Claude's architecture
- Create a seamless memory experience without requiring explicit functions
- Ensure proper isolation and security model for memory access

### Cross-Device Synchronization

- Add cloud synchronization option for memories
- Implement encrypted storage for sensitive memories
- Create multi-user memory management with proper permissions

## Technical Enhancements

### Advanced Vector Search

- Add customizable embedding models
- Implement hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
- Add support for multimodal memories (text, images, etc.)

### Performance Optimization

- Optimize for large memory stores (>100k memories)
- Implement memory caching for faster access
- Add batch operations for efficient memory management
