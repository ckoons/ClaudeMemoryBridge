# Future Enhancements for Claude Memory Bridge

This document outlines planned enhancements and feature ideas for future development.

## User Experience Improvements

### Clipboard Integration

Add the ability to automatically copy the import line to the clipboard when starting the memory bridge:

```bash
./cmb_start_all --clipboard
```

This would copy `from cmb.cli.quickmem import m, t, r, w, l, c, k, cx` to the clipboard, allowing users to start a Claude Code session and simply paste (Ctrl+V/Cmd+V) to enable memory access.

Implementation notes:
- Use platform-specific clipboard libraries:
  - macOS: `pbcopy` command or PyObjC 
  - Linux: `xclip` or `xsel`
  - Windows: `clip` command or `pywin32`
- Add detection for available clipboard mechanisms
- Add flag to enable/disable the feature

### Context Reloading

✅ **Implemented** in v0.3.2:
- Add a `load()` function (alias: `l()`) to restore previous session context
- Support loading multiple memories with `l(5)` to get the last 5 session memories

**Future Improvements**:
- Add targeted loading with `l("project: Agenteer")`
- Support filtering by metadata or content patterns
- Enable switching between projects by loading specific context sets
- Create UI component in web interface for session browsing

## Memory Management

### Memory Visualization Enhancements

✅ **Implemented** in v0.3.0:
- Create a web UI for browsing and managing memories
- Provide graphical interface for compartment management
- Show memory expiration dates and allow manual adjustment

**Future Improvements**:
- Add visualization of memory connections and relationships
- Build a timeline view of memory acquisition
- Add interactive graph-based visualization of memory networks
- Implement real-time memory monitoring dashboard
- Create custom visualization views for different user roles

### Memory Pruning and Summarization

- Implement importance scoring to prioritize memory retention
- Build memory summarization to consolidate similar memories
- Add automatic pruning of low-importance memories
- Create digest views of memory compartments
- Add manual editing capabilities for existing memories

## Integration Improvements

### Claude Native Integration

If Anthropic provides an API or mechanism for direct memory integration:
- Implement a plugin system compatible with Claude's architecture
- Create a seamless memory experience without requiring explicit functions
- Ensure proper isolation and security model for memory access
- Support native sharing of compartmentalized memory

### Cross-Device Synchronization

- Add cloud synchronization option for memories
- Implement encrypted storage for sensitive memories
- Create multi-user memory management with proper permissions
- Support shared compartments between users
- Add version control for collaborative memory editing

## Technical Enhancements

### Advanced Vector Search

- Add customizable embedding models
- Implement hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
- Add support for multimodal memories (text, images, etc.)
- Improve context-aware ranking of search results
- Add filtering options (date range, source, confidence)

### Performance Optimization

- Optimize for large memory stores (>100k memories)
- Implement memory caching for faster access
- Add batch operations for efficient memory management
- Improve compartment loading performance
- Add parallel processing for memory operations
