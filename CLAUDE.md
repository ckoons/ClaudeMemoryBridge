# Claude Memory Bridge Development Notes

## Project Overview

Claude Memory Bridge (CMB) is a project to give Claude persistent memory across different sessions. The project aims to:

1. Allow Claude to remember past conversations
2. Enable Claude to store and retrieve its own thoughts
3. Maintain longterm, high-priority memories
4. Share context across different projects
5. Automatically categorize and prioritize information by importance
6. Provide context-aware memory retrieval for conversations

## Key Features

- **Balanced Memory System**:
  - Structured Memory: File-based storage with categorized organization
  - Memory Importance Ranking: 1-5 scale with prioritized retrieval
  - Enhanced Retrieval: Context-aware memory loading
  - Nexus Interface: Standardized API for memory-enabled AI assistants
- Multiple memory categories (personal, projects, facts, preferences, session, private)
- Both vector-based (using Qdrant and sentence-transformers) and fallback memory implementations
- Auto-categorization based on content analysis
- Memory digests for session start context
- Simple Claude helper interface for store/retrieve operations
- Easy-to-use CLI for starting the memory service

## Code Style and Conventions

### Python

- Use f-strings for string formatting
- Add type hints to function signatures
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- 4 spaces for indentation
- Use docstrings for all functions and classes

### Comments

- Include brief comments for complex sections
- Add TODOs for future improvements
- Document any workarounds or tricky implementations

### Error Handling

- Use try/except blocks for operations that could fail
- Log errors with appropriate level (info, warning, error)
- Return meaningful error messages

### Commit Messages

## Common Commands

### Service Management

```bash
# Start memory bridge
cd ~/projects/github/Engram
./engram_consolidated

# With custom client ID
./engram_consolidated --client-id project-x

# Check service status and start if needed
./engram_check.py --start

# Test vector database integration
./vector_db_setup.py --test

# Run tests
cd ~/projects/github/Engram
python -m pytest tests

# Install development version
cd ~/projects/github/Engram
pip install -e .
```

### Structured Memory & Nexus

```python
# Import Structured Memory core components
from engram.core.structured_memory import StructuredMemory
from engram.core.nexus import NexusInterface
from engram.core.memory import MemoryService

# Initialize components
memory_service = MemoryService(client_id="claude")
structured_memory = StructuredMemory(client_id="claude")
nexus = NexusInterface(memory_service=memory_service, structured_memory=structured_memory)

# Start a Nexus session
await nexus.start_session("Project Discussion")

# Process a user message with memory enrichment
enriched_message = await nexus.process_message("Let's discuss structured memory", is_user=True)

# Store a memory with auto-categorization
await structured_memory.add_auto_categorized_memory(
    content="The structured memory system has importance levels from 1-5"
)

# Get a memory digest
digest = await structured_memory.get_memory_digest(max_memories=10, include_private=False)
```

### QuickMem Shortcuts

```python
# Import QuickMem for structured memory and Nexus
from engram.cli.quickmem import memory_digest, start_nexus, process_message, auto_remember, end_nexus
from engram.cli.quickmem import m, t, r, w, l, c, k, s, a, p, v, d, n, q, y, z

# Get memory digest (ultra-short version: d)
await memory_digest(max_memories=10)

# Start a Nexus session (ultra-short version: n)
await start_nexus("Project Discussion")

# Process a message (ultra-short version: q)
await process_message("Let's discuss the structured memory implementation", is_user=True)

# Auto-remember something (ultra-short version: z)
await auto_remember("The structured memory system uses importance levels from 1 to 5")
```

## Latest Updates (March 19, 2025)

### Memory System Improvements

1. **Vector Storage Implementation**:
   - Replaced mem0ai dependency with direct Qdrant and sentence-transformers integration
   - Implemented native vector embedding and semantic search capabilities
   - Enhanced error handling and graceful fallback to file-based storage
   - Added comprehensive vector database testing tools
   - Improved compatibility with different Qdrant client API versions

2. **Service Reliability**:
   - Fixed port conflict detection and handling
   - Improved service startup and status checking
   - Added comprehensive error reporting during service initialization
   - Enhanced health endpoint with implementation details

3. **Engram Script Enhancements**:
   - Fixed issue with engram_with_claude script detection of running services
   - Added port availability checking before starting services
   - Improved error logging for better troubleshooting
   - Enhanced process management with proper PID tracking

### Implementation Status

As of March 19, 2025, Engram has been enhanced with direct vector database integration using Qdrant and sentence-transformers. The system is designed to work correctly with or without vector database components while maintaining its core functionalities:

- Storage and retrieval of memories works in all implementations
- Semantic search with proper relevance scoring when vector DB is available  
- Context-aware memory loading functions correctly
- Structured memory and Nexus interfaces operate as expected
- Memory compartmentalization and expiration controls work in all modes

When the vector database components are available, the system will automatically use vector search for enhanced semantic retrieval. When unavailable, the system automatically falls back to file-based storage with keyword matching, with clear logging of the fallback status.

## Future Enhancements

1. Advanced NLP for memory auto-categorization (beyond pattern matching)
2. Memory embeddings for more accurate context retrieval
3. Memory pruning and consolidation for older content
4. Multi-user support with shared memory spaces
5. Integration with other AI systems beyond Claude
6. Enhanced web UI for structured memory browsing and visualization
7. Hierarchical memory organization within categories
8. Memory federation for sharing across instances 
9. Conversation topic detection and auto-compartmentalization

## Deployment Notes

The memory bridge should be run as a separate service, ideally started when the system boots. It can be run:

1. Directly: `./cmb_start.sh`
2. Via system service: Create a systemd or launchd service
3. As a background process: `nohup ./cmb_start.sh &`

For production use, consider running behind a proper web server like nginx with authentication.
