# Engram Migration Completed

## Migration Summary

The migration from Claude Memory Bridge (CMB) to Engram has been completed on March 17, 2025. All references to CMB have been removed from files outside the cmb/ directory, and all necessary files have been created in the engram namespace.

## Key Changes

1. **Namespace Updates**:
   - Updated all import statements from `cmb.*` to `engram.*`
   - Created missing files in the engram namespace, including consolidated_server.py
   - Updated version numbers to 0.6.0 across all relevant files

2. **Environment Variable Updates**:
   - Replaced CMB_CLIENT_ID with ENGRAM_CLIENT_ID
   - Replaced CMB_DATA_DIR with ENGRAM_DATA_DIR
   - Replaced CMB_HTTP_URL with ENGRAM_HTTP_URL
   - Replaced CMB_SERVER_URL with ENGRAM_SERVER_URL

3. **Script Updates**:
   - Updated script names and references
   - Updated help messages and documentation
   - Updated process detection to only look for engram processes

4. **UI and Message Updates**:
   - Changed "Claude Memory Bridge" to "Engram Memory" in user-facing messages
   - Updated API root endpoint message
   - Updated example files and tests

## Backward Compatibility

The `cmb/` directory has been kept as a legacy compatibility layer. It imports from the engram namespace and provides appropriate deprecation warnings. This ensures existing code using the cmb namespace will continue to work but encourage migration to the engram namespace.

## Version History

- **0.6.0**: Migration to Engram namespace complete
- **0.5.0**: Consolidated server implementation
- **0.4.0**: Structured memory and Nexus interface
- **0.3.0**: Memory compartments and privacy features
- **0.2.0**: Multiple memory namespaces and HTTP wrapper
- **0.1.0**: Initial release with basic memory storage

## Next Steps

1. Complete comprehensive testing of all features with the new namespace
2. Update documentation to reference Engram exclusively
3. Gradually phase out the cmb compatibility layer in future releases
4. Integrate with other AI platforms beyond Claude
