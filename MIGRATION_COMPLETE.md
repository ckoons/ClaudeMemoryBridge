# Engram Migration Completed

## Migration Summary

The migration from Claude Memory Bridge (CMB) to Engram has been completed on March 21, 2025. The final phase of migration is now complete:

1. **Phase 1 (March 17, 2025)**: All references to CMB were removed from files outside the cmb/ directory, and all necessary files were created in the engram namespace
2. **Phase 2 (March 19, 2025)**: ChromaDB vector storage was replaced with FAISS for NumPy 2.x compatibility
3. **Phase 3 (March 21, 2025)**: The `cmb/` directory has been completely removed, with a compatibility layer provided

## Key Changes

1. **Namespace Updates**:
   - Updated all import statements from `cmb.*` to `engram.*`
   - Created missing files in the engram namespace, including consolidated_server.py
   - Updated version numbers to 0.8.0 across all relevant files

2. **Environment Variable Updates**:
   - Replaced CMB_CLIENT_ID with ENGRAM_CLIENT_ID
   - Replaced CMB_DATA_DIR with ENGRAM_DATA_DIR
   - Replaced CMB_HTTP_URL with ENGRAM_HTTP_URL
   - Replaced CMB_SERVER_URL with ENGRAM_SERVER_URL
   - Replaced CMB_WEB_HOST with ENGRAM_WEB_HOST
   - Replaced CMB_WEB_PORT with ENGRAM_WEB_PORT
   - Replaced CMB_WEB_DEBUG with ENGRAM_WEB_DEBUG

3. **Script Updates**:
   - Updated script names and references
   - Updated help messages and documentation
   - Updated process detection to only look for engram processes

4. **Vector Database Changes**:
   - Replaced ChromaDB with FAISS for vector storage
   - Created deterministic embedding approach that doesn't require external models
   - Ensured NumPy 2.x compatibility
   - Simplified dependency management

5. **CMB Directory Removal**:
   - Completely removed the `cmb/` directory
   - Provided `cmb_compat.py` compatibility layer for legacy code
   - Updated all imports in tests, examples, and scripts

## Updating Your Code

### Import Changes

Update all imports in your Python code to use the `engram` package:

```python
# Old imports
from cmb.core.memory import MemoryService
from cmb.core.structured_memory import StructuredMemory
from cmb.core.nexus import NexusInterface
from cmb.cli.quickmem import memory_digest, auto_remember

# New imports
from engram.core.memory_faiss import MemoryService
from engram.core.structured_memory import StructuredMemory
from engram.core.nexus import NexusInterface
from engram.cli.quickmem import memory_digest, auto_remember
```

### Environment Variables

Update any environment variables in your scripts or configuration:

- `CMB_CLIENT_ID` → `ENGRAM_CLIENT_ID`
- `CMB_DATA_DIR` → `ENGRAM_DATA_DIR`
- `CMB_BASE_URL` → `ENGRAM_BASE_URL`
- `CMB_HTTP_URL` → `ENGRAM_HTTP_URL`
- `CMB_WEB_HOST` → `ENGRAM_WEB_HOST`
- `CMB_WEB_PORT` → `ENGRAM_WEB_PORT`
- `CMB_WEB_DEBUG` → `ENGRAM_WEB_DEBUG`

### Transitional Support

We've included a compatibility layer (`cmb_compat.py`) that allows legacy code to continue working during the transition. To use it:

```python
import cmb_compat  # Import this first

# Then continue using cmb imports, which will be redirected to engram
from cmb.core.memory import MemoryService
```

**Note**: The compatibility layer will display deprecation warnings and will be removed in a future release (6+ months). We recommend updating your imports directly.
